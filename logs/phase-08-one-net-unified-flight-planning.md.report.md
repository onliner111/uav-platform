# Phase Report

- Phase: `phase-08-one-net-unified-flight-planning.md`
- Status: `SUCCESS`

## What was delivered
- Added one-net-unified-flight stage planning blueprint aligned to `项目最终目标.md`.
- Decomposed Phase 08 into executable sub-phases:
  - `phase-08a-org-rbac-foundation.md`
  - `phase-08b-data-perimeter-policy.md`
  - `phase-08c-audit-hardening.md`
  - `phase-08d-integration-acceptance.md`
- Updated execution chain and checkpoint to start from `phase-08a-org-rbac-foundation.md` in `READY` state.

## How to verify
- `Get-Content phases/index.md`
- `Get-Content phases/state.md`
- `Get-Content phases/resume.md`
- `Get-Content docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `Get-Content logs/PROGRESS.md`

## Demos
- Open `phases/phase-08-one-net-unified-flight-planning.md` for full 08-15 roadmap.
- Open `phases/phase-08a-org-rbac-foundation.md` for current executable phase scope.

## Risks / Notes
- This delivery is planning/governance only; no product code implementation started.
- Quality gate commands remain from prior baseline; new implementation work must rerun full gate.
- Phase 08A execution details still require concrete API/model task breakdown before coding.
